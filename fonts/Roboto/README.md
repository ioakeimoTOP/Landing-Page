# Modifications to the Original Distribution

The Original Distribution of the 'Roboto' font-family package as acquired from
[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
provides a variety of styles as ttf implementations.

In this instance, the following originally included files have been completely excluded for the needs and purposes of this project:

- Roboto-BlackItalic.ttf
- Roboto-BoldItalic.ttf
- Roboto-Italic.ttf
- Roboto-light.ttf
- Roboto-Medium.ttf
- Roboto-MediumItalic.ttf
- Roboto-Thin.ttf

For the remaining files, post-processing was applied to produce web compatible fonts using `woff2_compress`.
